# saab-03-06-sid-hpd
The main goal of this Repo/library is to interface with the SID in a simpler way than sending all the raw commands. 

I have made it to use together with other code to get the current infotainment mode (FM(1/2), AM, CD(C/X), AUX) and changing the data displayed in the AUX mode for bluetooth metadata.

#WORK IN PROGRESS
